# Abstract

Portable Application Development KIT (PADKIT) is a library of C macros, structs, and functions designed to support the average command-line program developer. C is a popular language among embedded, automotive, and operating system (OS) software developers. For this reason, C has many features that accommodate the low-level needs of these developers. However, for the same reason, C has many confusing features for an average command-line programmer. An excess abundance of C standards, conventions, and principles designed for domain-specific use cases makes it almost impossible to decide on a consistent way of implementing an average command-line program. After forcing myself to implement many ambitious projects solely in C, I have developed a set of best practices, conventions, and principles to write a modern command-line program. I implemented PADKIT using these guidelines. In this documentation, I provide examples to demonstrate the usefulness of PADKIT. I also provide all the design details of PADKIT and the rationale behind them. My main aim is not to promote C as the single most dominant programming language but to propose a novel set of ideas that could change how to approach coding. I believe that if C remains widespread as it is, PADKIT will one day become an essential swiss-knife for the average coder.
