# PADKIT: Portable Application Development KIT for C 

# Abstract

Portable Application (App.) Development (Dev.) KIT (PADKIT) is a library of C macros, structs, and functions designed to support the average command-line program developer. C is a popular language among embedded, automotive, and operating system (OS) software developers. For this reason, C has a lot of features accomodating the low-level needs of these developers. However, for the same reason, C has a lot of confusing features for an average command-line programmer. After forcing myself to use only C to program the tools proposed in my most ambitious academic papers, I packaged into PADKIT; a set of common macros, structs, and functions that could be reused in a diverse set of situations.
