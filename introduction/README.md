# A. Introduction

Formally, PADKIT is a collection of the following three components.

1. A detailed C setup guide for MacOS, Linux, and Windows.
2. A set of C conventions that adopt or reject C language features w.r.t. established C standards.
3. A C library that builds on top of only the standard C library.

I designed PADKIT to accommodate the needs of a general-purpose C program.
