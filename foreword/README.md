> If I do not spend time tidying up my room today, I may use that time more productively. If I leave my room untidy for a month, even all the time in the world cannot make me productive anymore.

Why tidy the room NOW? Well, I had to spend the effort to prepare PADKIT and you are willing to spend time to read this, so this has to be the time.

There are tons of languages out there trying to add new features on top of C. Even then, C is not going away. Probably never. But, C is not standing still; it is slowly evolving even as you read this sentence. So, there has to be a PADKIT for those everyday C users out there. Even then, you, dear reader, will find that as standards and environments evolve, your little 10K codebase inevitably requires some maintenance. PADKIT's value will shine through when you have a lot of such projects and PADKIT makes your life much easier.
