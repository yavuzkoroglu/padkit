# Foreword

> If I do not spend time tidying up my room today, I may use that time more productively. If I leave my room untidy for a month, even all the time in the world cannot make me productive anymore.

No better words can describe the long and tumultuous history of the C programming language. Over half a century, C has endured many questionable coding practices, conventions, and inventions, not by withdrawing all these germs from its syntax and semantics but by accumulating them like swept dust under a carpet. Like the person with whom you cannot stand to be together even for an hour but always miss when you are away, C eventually became the phoenix that revives every time it dies. The effort I put into preparing PADKIT and the time you are willing to spend learning all its twists and turns are testaments - despite the considerable cost - to the need to tidy the room, at least this one time, so that coding may become enjoyable beyond imagination.
